        <p> During compartment fire behavior training (CfBT) sessions firefighters use shipping
            containers where they simulate different stages a fire source or the surroundings go
            through during a fire. Firefighters learn how to react and what the dangers are
            during every different stage.

            The goal of this project is to equip such a container with temperature sensors, at around 10 different
            locations that can withstand the harsh conditions (temperatures of +500Â°C) and send their data wired or
            wireless to a device (e.g. tablet) where a heat map of the inside of this container can be visualized and
            monitored throughout the spreading of the fire.
